## Features

**AyuGram** is built on top of 64Gram, which means we have all the features 64Gram has and some of ours:

- Disable read packets sending
- Disable online packets sending
- Disable typing & upload packets sending
- Offline packet autosending
- Messages history (+ deleted ones)
- Using scheduled messages to keep offline

Technically, we have the **Ghost mode** starter pack.

Also, we have cool **purple icon** and **custom day/night themes**.

## Downloads? / FAQ?

We have both **Windows** *(by me)* and **Linux** *(by my friend)* builds.

Follow our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/ayugram1338). FAQ can be found here.

## May I get banned?

Well, *you* **can't**, because you're just an ordinary user.

## Localization?

I don't have enough knowledge in C++, so if you're willing to localize settings, please make a PR!
